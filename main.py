#for loops

for i in range (2):
  print ('jello')
  print (i)

# i is a variable, something that can change
# can use "print (i)" to print the number of times that the variable was printed
# you can say "print (i)" to see the number of times the word prints (starting from 0). if you dont want ti to start from 0, say "print (i+1)"




# conditionals: if/else statements

if x == 15:
  # use two = 
    print (x)
else:

# use backslash if you need to use ' in your sentence without ending the code
# no caps when you write code, unless variables
# elif= else + if




# dictionary

book = {
  'hello':'a greeting'}

print('hello: ' + book.get('hello'))

# has to be book.get
# to combine two strings together, use a +
# if you need to use multiple strings, use a comma outside of the apostrophes

word = 'words'
# string
# contains letters, vowels and symbols

j = '15'
# int/float
